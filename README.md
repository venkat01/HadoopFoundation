# HadoopFoundation
This contains the basic materials required for the Hadoop Foundation Course delivered by me.

1) Start with the Hadoop 2.7.2 setup document for setting up hadoop on your system

2) Then start with the Map Reduce examples in the Virtual Machine

3) Step 3 would be to try with the Hive Examples after setting up and configuring Hive

4) Step 4 would be to practice the Pig Examples after extracting and configuring Pig

5) Step 5 would be to setup the Sqoop and try with the import - export examples of moving data from MySQL to HDFS and vice versa.
